## 🏗 Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/           # Database models
│   ├── schemas/          # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── api/v1/endpoints/ # API endpoints
│   ├── core/             # Core configuration
│   └── services/         # Business logic
├── migrate_database.py   # Database migration script
└── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

### Database Schema
- **Users**: User accounts with roles and permissions
- **Workspaces**: Team/organization containers
- **WorkspaceMembers**: User-workspace relationships
- **Projects**: Project definitions within workspaces
- **Issues**: Individual work items with status tracking
- **Notifications**: User notification system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database Migration
If you have an existing database, run the migration script:

```bash
cd backend
python migrate_database.py
```

This will:
- Create new tables for the project management system
- Migrate existing user data
- Create a default workspace and sample project
- Clean up old chat-related tables

### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. API Endpoints

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./slack_saas.db

# JWT Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Optional Services
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## 📱 Frontend Integration

The frontend should be updated to use the new API endpoints. Key components needed:

### React Components
- **WorkspaceSelector**: Choose/create workspaces
- **ProjectList**: Display and manage projects
- **KanbanBoard**: Drag & drop issue management
- **IssueForm**: Create/edit issues
- **UserManagement**: Manage workspace members

### State Management
- **Workspace Context**: Current workspace state
- **Project Context**: Current project state
- **Issue Context**: Issue data and filters
- **User Context**: Authentication and permissions

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin/Member permissions
- **Workspace Isolation**: Users only see their workspaces
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schema validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: SQLAlchemy ORM

## 🧪 Testing

### API Testing
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Manual Testing
1. Create a new user account
2. Create a workspace
3. Add team members
4. Create a project
5. Add issues and move them through the Kanban board

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on foreign keys
- **Pagination**: Large result sets are paginated
- **Caching**: Redis integration for performance
- **Async Operations**: FastAPI async endpoints

## 🚧 Migration Notes

### What Changed
- **Channels → Projects**: Chat channels became project containers
- **Messages → Issues**: Chat messages became work items
- **Organizations → Workspaces**: Simplified to workspace concept
- **User Status → User Roles**: Added role-based permissions

### Data Preservation
- Existing users are preserved
- User passwords remain secure
- New default workspace is created
- Sample project and issues are added

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **File Attachments**: Support for issue attachments
- **Comments**: Issue discussion threads
- **Time Tracking**: Log time spent on issues
- **Reporting**: Analytics and progress reports
- **Integrations**: Webhook support for external tools
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications
